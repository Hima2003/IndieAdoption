            They are everywhere on the street, so they can't be cool right?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Indie dogs come with a bad rap. Similar to the bad reputation that
            the "Pitbull" breed in America suffers from. Indie dogs are known to
            be lowest rung in the dog breed ladder, and often thought of as a
            dangerous breed to have inside the house. This couldn't be further
            from the truth.

          <li><h3 style="text-align: left;">Indie dogs are more prone to rabies</h3></li>
          <div>
            <p>
              This is not true. They are just as much or just as less prone to
              rabies as any other breed of dogs. However, when you adopt a puppy
              make sure you vaccinate the puppy properly and go through the
              correct medical steps the first few months. This is true of any
              breed of dog.

          <div>
            <p>
              Indie dogs are one of the most loyal breeds. They will not abandon
              you and run away to the street. However, you have to make sure you
              sterilize your pet. If not, during mating season, it is possible
              that your dog will try to satisfy his needs, if you know what we
              mean. We highly recommding sterilization of any dog, be it breed
              or Indie.

            <p>
              Change your friends then! ðŸ¤£ Just kidding. This trend is changing.
              Its no longer a shameful thing to have an Indie dog be your best
              friend. In fact it is considered very cool as nothing else
              portrays your true inner self like the pet you have. National
              geographic did a beautiful articule on this trend which captures
              the spirit of adopting Indie's. But leave that aside. Ask
              yourself. Do you want to look cool, or actually, be cool? Yup.
              That's what we thought. ðŸ™Œ We love golden retrievers and labradors
              and beagles to bits. It's just that we just love Indie dogs a
              little bit more.
